Predicting Churn Customer using Classification Models


A manager at a local bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They need a way of predicting which customers are most likely to stop using their credit card products (Customer Churn) in order to proactively check in on the customer to provide them better services in order to convince them to change their minds. You are given a dataset of 10,000 customers with 18 features per customer. Roughly 16% of the current customer base have churned so far, so it will be difficult to predict the ones who will.

As you analyze the data, before you create the model, the sales team also needs you to determine the most influential factors that can lead to a customer's decision of leaving the business. The head of the sales department is expecting a report that helps them visualize where the differences lie between churning and non-churning customers.

Objectives:

- Identify which customers are most likely to be churned so the bank manager knows who to provide a better service to the Top Priority is to identify churning customers, as if we predict non-churning customers as churned, it won't harm our business, but predicting churning customers as non-churning will. False negatives won't hurt us, but False Positives do.
- This task is binary classification
- A clean and easy to understand visual report that helps the sales team better visualize what makes a client churn or not churn.
